# day-planner

This project is a planner to use to schedule out a given workday. The features of this project include the ability to enter text of what the activity is, save the entered text to the local storage of the page for future use, see the current time of the day, along with how the time relates to what activity has been entered with the current time.

## Installation

Use SSH github link in order to install this project ssh to install the day planner

```bash
clone git@github.com:keith-mikel/day-planner.git
```

## Usage

This day planner can be used by using the text boxes tied to a given hour of the workday to enter an activity as text. Once this is done the activities can be saved for future reference by using either the save button to the right of the designated box where the activity was entered, or by using the "save all" button at the top of the screen. Once the activities are entered and saved the planner will reflect the current time of the day to show what activities should have already been completed (shown in gray), what activities should be in process at that time (shown in red), and what activities are yet to come (shown in green). Once all activities have been completed, or you are ready to enter a new day, use the "Clear Day" to clear all entries to prepare for entering new data. Current data can also be left, and only select items can be deleted and reentered if desired by just deleting the text and saving newly entered text.
